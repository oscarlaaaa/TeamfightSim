# TeamfightSim #

## Purpose ##
This project is being made with the purpose of learning how to write java as well as to cheat in TFT heh. The initial idea behind this project is to make a simulator that can
give the user the odds of their team winning versus other teams. However, future direction includes:

-Real-time calculations overlaid on the screen
-Graphical models and such to make it look nice
-?

Also thanks Choonggao and vvn for being my inspos #respec

ROADMAP:
-Set up champion class and calculation semantics (DONE)
-Get an incremental system in place (DONE)
-Set up a 1v1 combat system that increments, shows combat progress, and announces winner before terminating the program (DONE)
-Set up randomish damage system
-Incorporate armour
-Figure out how to scale it up maybe?
-Add champion synergies
-Add items and effects
-Add multiple-champion simultaneous combat
-Incorporate skills maybe? that'd be hard
-Set up a GUI for the application
