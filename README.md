# TeamfightSim #

## Purpose ##
This project is being made with the purpose of learning how to write java as well as to cheat in TFT heh. The initial idea behind this project is to make a simulator that can
give the user the odds of their team winning versus other teams.

Also thanks Choonggao and vvn for being my inspos #respec
