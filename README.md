# TeamfightSim #

## Purpose ##
This project is being made with the purpose of learning how to write java as well as to cheat in TFT. The initial idea behind this project is to make a simulator that can
give the user the odds of their team winning versus other teams. However, future direction includes:

-Real-time calculations overlaid on the screen
-Graphical models and such to make it look nice
-?
